                      Iâ€™m currently working at XEKmate, a xerox systems
                      concessionaire. My job is to analyze the workplace of a
                      client and make sure it has enough room and resources to
                      install a MFP Xerox device, after the analysis, the
                      printer is installed in the client's office. The other
                      side of the job involves technical support (helpdesk)
                      through Anydesk and/or TeamViewer.

                      I used to work for PCQUATRO, the job involved building PCs
                      for individuals and enterprises, along with repairing
                      similar systems (PCs, laptops, AIOs). I also worked with
                      networking architectures, passing and building ethernet
                      cables for clients. This job also gave me experience with
                      helpdesk, tech support and selling products to clients
                      within the physical shop.
